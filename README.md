- Hi, Iâ€™m @TurtleHellMax
- I'm an unemployed and in-school aspiring game dev who makes random stuff.
- I use github rarely because I tend to just backup files to harddrives I guess.
- I promise I do more than what you see here, I mean.
- Anyway, you can email me whatever at: maxstinkyfoot@gmail.com
